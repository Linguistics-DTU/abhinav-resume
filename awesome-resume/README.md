### abhi18av-resume

This repo has the latex source for my resume!

The basic LaTex template these are based upon if from (https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) and I've been doing the live editing work on ( https://www.overleaf.com/dash ).

I highly recommend these two if you like look and feel of the resume.
