\cvparagraph{About Me}
I'm ever more curious about "What is human?" and I find that the gift of languages is a vital part of the puzzle. I wish to contribute to our collective knowledge and understanding about languages, I find that this is the most fascinating thing about our species, about culture.

\cvparagraph{Why Languages?}
I feel that something as simple as languages and yet so close to essence of our human lives, society still has many undiscovered secrets. I feel that we can still learn a lot from our natural gifts, much like Neural Networks and perhaps there's new Mathematics which is just waiting to be understood!

\cvparagraph{Why Computational Linguistics?}
I am really inspired by the fact that we can use computers as a tool to understand ourselves, to me that's an intriguing idea. There have been so many wonderful advances in Linguistics and Computer Science, I believe that there's something really interesting at the cross-roads.
